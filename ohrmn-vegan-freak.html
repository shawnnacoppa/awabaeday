It was awesome, all three of my children and my wife raved about it, we will definitely be making this again.”. It drives me nuts that I don't know what happened. Basically Bob and Jenna dropped off the internet in 2009 and no one has heard from them since. Does anyone know anything. I tend to use podcasts as my number one source for info on everything. I am listening to Vegan Freak right now, but as someone who holds redditors in high esteem as awesome info mavens, please, please, please suggest some podcasts! Or video info sources as an alternative. A group of five of us are playing DampD online through Roll20 and we're looking for another player or two. All of us were on the Vegan Freak Forums back in the day and we've been friends for maybe a decade. A couple years ago we started playing the Tyranny of Dragons campaign (5th edition) online through Roll20.net (https://Roll20.net) since we're not all in the same place, but as life goes on we need to find some more players to keep the game going regularly. So we thought we'd pitch It's not the first term to be used for this purpose -- I was active in the Vegan Freak forums and podcast in my early vegan days --but lately I've been thinking about it more. I mostly block out the surrounding world in my daily life as I guess that makes it possible to function, but when you actually think about how hopelessly violent this world is  I'm not entirely sure how vegans survive in this world after learning everything we'd been taught was lies, and then it feels like everyone. 
"Nutritional yeast flakes" is too much. It's not cute, it sounds weird and non-vegans freak out when they see it and they make that face  You know the face. Something so yummy deserves better than that face. Nyf sounds cooler. Nifty, even. :D My favorite thing to dump them on is a sweet potato with olive oil and smoked salt. Got a favorite. I'm planning to buy one of these and I can't decide which one so I'm looking for some reviews or rankings of them. The thing I'm most concerned about taste and finding something that doesn't have that thick chalky flavour since I've had bad luck with that in the past with other powders - Vegessential all in one - pharmafreak vegan freak - north coast naturals vege pro-7 vanilla - sunwarrior blend vanilla Or any of the other powders on this list https://www.popeyescanada.com/vegan.html. Hey Vegans, Today I took my first poop since January 27! Unlike you vegan freaks who need to poop every day because of your strange diet containing beans, fungi, and vegetables, I can go 2 whole weeks without needing to use my bowels. Instead of just sliding out easily like your deformed vegan poops do, my poop involved pushing and groaning for a full 80 minutes because I am a real manly man that eats meat and doesn’t take the easy way out. When it was complete there was a glorious Hooray! Today is /r/vegan's first Friday Member Spotlight! And who better to get us started than the (in)famous /u/lnfinity! I think we've come up with a pretty good list of questions here, and in the interest of giving everyone the same experience when they are featured, I'd like to keep these questions pretty much the same (unless there is something you guys feel REALLY needs to be changed). BUT! One of the cool things about these threads is that the comments section 
Please help me by answering two questions: 1. Two friends just went vegetarian and possibly will go vegan this week and I am STOKED. I have read a lot but I want to know your recommendations for the best book to recommend to them first. I am looking for something easy to read, which probably goes into both the ethics, nutrition, and general information. I want to hook, line, and sinker these two friends since they watched the documentaries and are inspired at the moment :) 2. Where I'm always on the lookout for vegan/health books to read. Does anyone have any recommendations on what to read next or what to move up higher on my reading list? These are some of the books I've read so far: How Not to Die by Michael Greger The China Study by Colin T. Campbell Becoming Vegan by Brenda Davis Becoming Raw by Brenda Davis The Food Revolution by John Robbins Deep Healing by Caroline Marie DuPont Vegan Freak by Bob Torres Eating Animals by Jonathan Safran Foer The Amazing Liver. A week ago I posted an informal survey (https://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/4c61t6/survey_what_led_to_you_becoming_vegan/) here about peoples' journeys to veganism. The goal was to identify what forms of exposure to veganism are more/less effective in terms of leading people to adopt veganism, or at the very least to develop positive attitudes towards it. Survey Limitations The survey was by no means perfect, but it was good-enough to make a few rough/tentative conclusions. Seems like a first world problem but as realistic veggie meats become more popular, my restaurant food choices may actually be reduced. История.

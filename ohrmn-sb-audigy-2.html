The Sound Blaster family of sound cards was the de facto standard for consumer audio on the IBM PC compatible system platform, until the widespread transition to Microsoft Windows 95, which standardized the programming interface at application level (eliminating the importance of backward compatibility with Sound Blaster), and the evolution in PC design led to onboard audio electronics, which. I recently built my first pc and was using onboard audio (asrock z75 pro3) for a while until my dad gave me his old SB Audigy 2. After a lot of searching I found drivers that (sort of) work, I get sound and 5.1 surround in games. Lately I have been wanting to use my old headset again (turtle beach x12 from my xbox days). When plugged into my onboard audio port it wasn't working and upon closer inspection I can only use my audigy 2 or the Nvidia HD audio, no onboard available. Trying to remove/re.

So I've been trudging along pretty damn well with this whole VFIO thing within the last week, and I'll be damned if I've not found my first hiccup that's got me utterly stumped. No amount of googling seems to come up with any solutions that actually work. I even tried passing the MB's onboard audio to the VM to just work around it, but still no joy.

My mic broke on my PC360's and I was thinking of getting a ModMic V4 to replace it, but at the same time. I thought maybe it be worth looking into getting the GSP 300's to replace the entire headset anyway. I'm using a Creative SB Audigy RX for my sound. I been looking over at the specifications for both and can't really decide. So, would swapping to the GSP 300 be a big downgrade or not? Headphones are for gaming, general PC usage, videos, and music. I recently decided to upgrade my office to surround sound. I had my PC connected to a Yamaha amp via optical cable, and seemed to be enjoying sound from the front and center speakers. After the surround installation, I was setting up the rears after downloading and playing a 5.1 speaker test audio file, but did not seem to be able to get any audio from them, or the center speaker. I am using a PC program called VoiceMeeter which displays levels of individual channels, so I could see the audio. So I've just installed Dead Air, no addons except the English translation.

I built a new PC \(build post will come in a few days, still have to put a few touches in although I've had it for over a month now\). And I really don't like the Realtek software and the baggage that comes with it \(just a personal pet peeve\), so I decided to check if the cards worked \(maybe give them to someone who does some music stuff or sell them for cheap\). I'm looking to upgrade my PC. I have ~0 to play with to get it up to speed. Current use is basically gaming while watching youtube, netflix or twitch streams.

Hey everyone, I've cleaned out my pc which has been collecting dust for years and it's finally working again. Other than the graphics card the pc is 10 years old and while I can play games like rocket league fine I won't be able to play newer games that well. I was hoping to buy a component or two to try and make my pc able to play some newer games. I'm only a casual gamer so I don't want to buy a completely new computer, especially since parts are so expensive in Australia.

Hey, I've been playing Titanfall 2 for a little while now, and I've encountered some strange issues with the audio. On some maps, notably Forwardbase Kodai, the audio gets really choppy, and crackles horribly. I can't hear anything else but the crackling, and then it goes away suddenly and the normal sounds resume. And then it starts again, and so on. It really makes the game unplayable at times, and I can't figure out what to do.
